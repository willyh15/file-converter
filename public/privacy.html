      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><em>Last updated: 2025-11-27</em></p>

      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        GhostConvert ("we", "us", "our") provides free online file conversion tools.
        We aim to collect and store as little personal data as possible while still
        operating, protecting, and improving the service.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Files You Upload</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Files are uploaded only for the purpose of conversion.</li>
        <li>Converted output files are stored temporarily so you can download them.</li>
        <li>Files are automatically removed after a short period or as part of routine cleanup.</li>
        <li>We do not sell or share the contents of your files with third parties.</li>
        <li>We do not manually review your files except when needed to investigate abuse, security issues, or bugs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Technical and Usage Data</h2>
      <p>
        When you use GhostConvert, our servers may automatically log technical data such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>Browser type and version</li>
        <li>Operating system</li>
        <li>Referring URLs</li>
        <li>Date and time of access</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information is used for security, abuse prevention, debugging, and basic usage analytics.
        Logs are retained for a limited period and are not used to personally identify regular users.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
      <p>
        GhostConvert may use simple cookies or local storage to remember preferences
        (for example, last used tool or basic UI settings). These are used to keep
        the site functional and easy to use.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Third Party Analytics (Google Analytics)</h2>
      <p>
        We use Google Analytics 4 to understand how visitors use GhostConvert
        (for example, which tools are used most, overall traffic patterns, and basic engagement).
        Google Analytics collects information such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pages visited and actions taken on the site</li>
        <li>Approximate location (based on IP address)</li>
        <li>Device and browser information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information is processed by Google on our behalf and is used in aggregate to
        improve and maintain the service. You can learn how Google uses data from sites and apps
        that use their services at:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites
        </a>.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Third Party Advertising (Google AdSense)</h2>
      <p>
        GhostConvert displays ads served by Google AdSense. These ads help keep the service free.
        Google and its partners may use cookies and similar technologies to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Serve and measure ads on this site</li>
        <li>Prevent fraud and abuse</li>
        <li>Perform basic ad reporting and analytics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Depending on your region and settings, Google may show personalized or non-personalized ads.
        Personalized ads use information such as your previous visits to this and other sites.
        You can manage your ad settings at:
        <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          https://adssettings.google.com
        </a>
        and learn more in Google's advertising privacy policies.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Third Party Service Providers</h2>
      <p>
        We may use third party services such as hosting providers, security tools,
        logging and monitoring tools, analytics, and advertising networks to operate GhostConvert.
        These providers may process limited data on our behalf, under their own privacy policies
        and data processing agreements.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data.
        However, no online service can guarantee absolute security. You use GhostConvert at your own risk,
        and you should avoid uploading highly sensitive or confidential files.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Conversion files are kept only as long as needed to process and provide the result to you,
        and then removed as part of periodic cleanup. Server logs are retained for a limited time
        for security, debugging, and maintenance, and then deleted or anonymized.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        GhostConvert is not directed to children under 13. If you are under 13,
        you should use this service only with the permission and supervision of a parent or guardian.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Your Choices</h2>
      <p>
        If you do not want cookies or tracking technologies to be used, you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adjust your browser settings to block or limit cookies.</li>
        <li>Use browser add-ons that block analytics and advertising scripts.</li>
        <li>Update your Google ad and privacy settings at the links provided above.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that blocking cookies or scripts may impact how GhostConvert functions.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the
        "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the service after
        changes are posted means you accept the updated policy.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Contact</h2>
